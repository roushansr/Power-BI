This dataset is taken from "Maven Environmental Challenge".
You can find the task and all three datasets along with Data Dictionary.

The tasks to be focussed upon are - 

1.How much has Apple reduced their emissions from 2015 to 2022?

2.How does this trend compare to their revenue & market cap trend in the same period?

3.Which areas have seen the most improvement? What about the least?

4.Is Apple on track to meet their 2030 goal of net zero emissions?
